        <br>Hello! My name is Zoe and I'm a multidisciplinary designer based in Argentina. I'm a passionate digital artist and I just graduated from the undegraduate degree in Design and Digital Animation from the Universidad de Belgrano (Argentina). I'm experienced in many areas such as character design, illustration, animation and concept art but my favourite is illustration.</br>

        <br>I love to create images that are stylized and evoque pleasant sensations through the serenity of the environment or the round-like character designs. If you took a peak to my gallery, you might have realized as well that I most enjoy projects that involve drawing animals of some sort.</br>

        <br>I'm knowledgeable in some other areas too such as 3D and web development (CSS, HTML, Javascript). I am very flexible, always happy to learn new things and adapt to different environments.</br>

        <br>I was born in Buenos Aires in the year 2000, and also I have Polish citizenship which means I am able to take and / or relocate to any projects happening within the European Union. I speak native Spanish and fluently English (C2), and a bit of Russian too.
        Thank you for passing by!</br>
